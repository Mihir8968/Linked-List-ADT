# Linked List Abstract Data Type (ADT)

## Overview

This project implements a Linked List Abstract Data Type (ADT) in C++. It provides various operations that can be performed on a singly linked list, including insertion, deletion, search, reversal, concatenation, merging, and detection of loops. The linked list is designed to be flexible and efficient, making it a useful data structure for a wide range of applications.

## Features

- **Insertion**: Insert a node at any valid position in the list.
- **Deletion**: Delete a node by its value.
- **Display**: Print all the elements in the list.
- **Reverse**: Reverse the linked list.
- **Concatenation**: Concatenate another linked list to the current list.
- **Length**: Get the current size of the list.
- **Search**: Find a node by its value.
- **Merge**: Merge another sorted linked list with the current sorted linked list.
- **Loop Detection**: Detect if there is a loop in the list.
- **Loop Creation**: Create a loop by connecting the last node to a node with a specific value.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++11 or later
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)

### Compilation

To compile the test program, use the following command:

```bash
g++ test.cpp -o testLinkedList
